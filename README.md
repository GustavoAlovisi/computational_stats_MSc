## computational_stats_MSc
#This is a repo for graduate Computational Statistics problem sets and class information/data. 

It includes my codes for topics as 
- Fitting k-means clustering by minimizing variance/objective function
- General Stats Optimization topics such as maximization of different likelihood functions: non-linear, constrained, block relaxtion ones, etc
- Expectation Maximization Algorithm for a mixture of Multivariate Gaussians
- Bootstrap and Permutation for linear regression and other problems 
- Monte Carlo methods and Importance Sampling
- Markov-Chain Monte Carlo for bayesian stats: Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs-Sampler for bayesian regression
- Hidden Markov Chains applied to finance 
- Some linear algebra topics
- Course Final Work: I've used an Sequential Quadratic Programming method for optimizing mixture copula parameters instead of classical EM algos. To assess performance i've conducted some Monte Carlo expectation and s.d. estimation of a simulated mixture. Used the proposed optimization to financial portfolio optimization problem.
